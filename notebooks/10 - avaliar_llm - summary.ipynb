       "In the first chapter of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\" Alice grows bored while sitting with her sister and notices a White Rabbit with pink eyes, who appears to be in a hurry and possesses a watch. Driven by curiosity, Alice follows the Rabbit down a rabbit hole, where she falls for a long time, pondering various whimsical thoughts. Upon landing safely, she explores a hall filled with locked doors and discovers a tiny key and a small door that leads to a beautiful garden. However, she cannot fit through the door. After finding a bottle labeled \"DRINK ME,\" Alice drinks from it and shrinks to a size small enough to enter the garden but realizes she left the key on the table. In her attempts to reach it, she eats a cake labeled \"EAT ME,\" hoping it will change her size.\n",

The hall is illuminated by lamps, and there are various objects like a three-legged glass table and shelves along the walls, leading to a small door that opens into a beautiful garden.\n",

She discovers a tiny golden key and a little door that leads to a lovely garden but cannot fit through. Alice drinks from a bottle, shrinking herself to the right size to enter but then forgets the key on the table. In her frustration, she eats a cake hoping to grow larger or smaller to reach the key, setting her on a path of curious adventures."
